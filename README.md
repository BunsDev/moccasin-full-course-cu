## Recommended Tools

- Recommended Testnet: Sepolia
- Recommended DevOps: [foundry-devops](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-devops)

# [Testnet Faucets](https://faucets.chain.link)

If you receive a flag pop-up requiring you to have 0.001 ETH on mainnet, you may be able to wait 10 to 20 minutes and try again to avoid adding the 0.001 ETH on the mainnet.

- Main (Sepolia): <a href="https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia" target="_blank"> Sepolia GCP Faucet </a>
- Alchemy Faucet (Sepolia):<a href="https://sepoliafaucet.com/" target="_blank"> https://sepoliafaucet.com/</a>
- Infura Faucet (Sepolia):<a href="https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia" target="_blank" > https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia</a>
- Chainlink Faucet (Sepolia):<a href="https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia" target="_blank" > https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia</a>
  - No need for 0.001 ETH on mainnet
- ZKsync Faucets (ZKsync Sepolia):<a href="https://docs.zksync.io/build/tooling/network-faucets.html" target="_blank"> https://docs.zksync.io/build/tooling/network-faucets.html</a>

# Bonus NFTs

These are 100% optional to do.

- *Coming soon...*

After every section, in this GitHub repo will be a link to a contract on Sepolia or ZKsync. They contain a challenge for you to solve, and in return, you'll be given an AWESOME NFT.

## Important Notes for ZKsync

IF YOU DECIDE TO MINT THE REAL NFT:

1. We didn't audit the NFT, so if you want to make sure you'll be safe, interact with the contract using a burner wallet (a wallet with very little money that you don't use for anything else)
   1. In fact... Get good at interacting with wallets from a burner wallet
2. Read my [Tweet thread on basic wallet safety](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC/status/1663936101650685954)
3. It might be a good idea to wait till later in the course when we teach you about verifying metamask transactions.
4. Feel free to mint NFTs on sepolia without worrying about the above

## Bridging to ZKsync

1. The process for bridging looks like the following:
   1. Buy ETH (On an exchange like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/home) or [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/))
2. Send ETH -> one of your wallets like:
   1. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
   2. [Frame](https://frame.sh/)
   3. [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)
   4. [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/)
   5. [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
3. Use the [ZKsync Bridge](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/)

# Welcome to the Course Repo

## Best Practices

- **Follow the repository:** While going through the course be 100% certain to follow along with the github repository. If you run into an issue check the chronological-updates in the repo.
- **Be Active in the community:** Ask questions and engage with other developers going through the course in the discussions tab, be sure to go and say hello or gm! This space is different from the other industries, you don't have to be secretive; communicate, network and learn with others :)
- **Learn at your own pace:** It doesn't matter if it takes you a day, a week, a month or even a year. Progress >>> Perfection
- **Take Breaks:** You will exhaust your mind and recall less if you go all out and watch the entire course in one sitting.
  **Suggested Strategy** every 25 minutes take a 5 min break, and every 2 hours take a longer 30 min break
- **Refer to Documentation:** Things are constantly being updated, so whenever Patrick opens up some documentation, open it on your end and maybe even have the code sample next to you.
- **Use ChatGPT and/or the course chat**
